      <h2>
        <li>EYELINER</li>
      </h2>
      <p>Eye liner can be placed in various parts of the eye to create different looks with a winged eye liner or tight
        lined at the waterline. Eye liner can be drawn above upper lashes or below lower lashes or both, even on the
        water lines of the eyes. Its primary purpose is to make the lashes look lush, but it also draws attention to the
        eye and can enhance or even change the eye's shape. Eye liner is available in a wide range of hues, from the
        common black, brown and grey to more adventurous shades such as bright primary colors, pastels, frosty silvers
        and golds, white and even glitter-flecked colors.It can be sold from #1500 and above.</p>

    <h2><li>FOUNDATION</li></h2>
    <p>Foundation is a liquid, cream, or powder makeup applied to the face and neck to create an even, uniform color to the complexion, cover flaws and, sometimes, to change the natural skin tone. Some foundations also function as a moisturizer, sunscreen, astringent or base layer for more complex cosmetics. Foundation applied to the body is generally referred to as "
          body painting" or "body makeup" . The prices for foundation varies, depending on the company.</p>

          <h2>
            <li>POWDER</li>
          </h2>
          <p>Face powder is a cosmetic product applied to the face to serve different functions, typically to beautify
            the face. Originating from ancient Egypt,[citation needed] face powder has had different social uses across
            cultures and in modern times, it is typically used to set makeup, brighten the skin and contour the face.
            Face powders generally come in two main types. One of which is loose powder, which is used to assist with
            oily skin in absorbing excess moisture and mattifying the face to reduce shininess. The other is pressed
            powder which conceals blemishes and maximises coverage. The price of face powder varies from one company to
            the other. It can be sold from #3000 and above.</p>

          <h2>
            <li>LIPSTICK</li>
          </h2>
          <p>Lipstick has been prominent in several women's fashion trends, often associated with women's sexuality. The
            color of lipstick has aesthetic and cultural significance as different colors carry different connotations.
            Red lipstick has historically been associated with sensuality or women's independence while black lipstick
            is worn by both men and women in alternative subcultures, especially punk and goth. Celebrities such as
            Marilyn Monroe, Elizabeth Taylor, Madonna, and Taylor Swift have contributed to the popularity and iconic
            images of lipstick in fashion and mainstream media. It is sold from #1000 to #10,000</p>

          <h2>
            <li>BEAUTY BLENDER</li>
          </h2>
          <p>Using a sponge to apply powder is one of the best ways to ensure your makeup is locked and loaded, since it
            allows you to set smaller areas—like under the eyes—that may be difficult to do with a powder brush. “I
            always use a damp Beautyblender in setting powder to ‘fake bake’ (my term for baking but not really),”
            explains Simkin. “I do a light press of translucent powder over concealer to set, then dust it off right
            away instead of letting it sit like a traditional ‘bake’ [or set].” Cheng tells SELF that she typically uses
            a sponge to set her clients’ T-zones. It is sold from #500 t0 #3000</p>

          <h2>
            <li>BRONZER</li>
          </h2>
          <p>Applying bronzer is a great way to add an attractive, natural-looking glow to your face, especially on
            those days when your skin appears a little dull. Applying bronzer incorrectly, however, can make your face
            look dirty or orange. Start by creating an even base using foundation and concealer. Then apply, blend, and
            set your bronzer to make your face glow with a warm radiance. It is sold from #1500 and above.</p>

          <h2>
            <li>BRUSHES</li>
          </h2>
          <p>Makeup brushes are integral to achieving a flawless, airbrushed look that’ll help you face your day with
            confidence. However, the extensive selection of brushes available on the market can make the buying
            experience intimidating. If you happen to buy a multi-pack set, you might not even know all of the makeup
            brushes’ names, or be able to discern their specific uses. Sure, using your finger as an applicator is a
            tried and true way to apply foundation, but if you want to graduate from amateur to pro in the beauty world,
            you need to arm yourself with the right knowledge to make it happen. The price for brushes varies in the
            market. One can get good set of brushes from #5000 and above.</p>

          <h2>
            <li>EYEPENCIL</li>
          </h2>
          <p>Eye liner is a versatile product that helps enhance and draw attention to the eyes. It comes in solid
            pencil, cream or liquid form. By tracing the outside of the lash lines, you can emphasize your natural eye
            shape or create the illusion of a different shape altogether. The best eye liners allow for precision and
            control, such as BRUSHSTROKE 24-HOUR LINER – a liquid eye liner with a precision tip that wears all day
            long. The price of eyepencil ranges from #100 to #3000.</p>

          <h2>
            <li>MASCARA</li>
          </h2>
          <p>Mascara is a cosmetic commonly used to enhance the upper and lower eyelashes. It is used to darken,
            thicken, lengthen, and/or define the eyelashes. Normally in one of three forms—liquid, powder, or cream—the
            modern mascara product has various formulas; however, most contain the same basic components of pigments,
            oils, waxes, and preservatives. The most common form of mascara is a liquid in a tube with an application
            brush. Price of mascara is from #1500 and above.</p>

          <h2>
            <li>SHADOWS</li>
          </h2>
          <p>Eye shadow can add depth and dimension to one's eyes, complement one's eye color, make one's eyes appear
            larger, or simply draw attention to the eyes. Eye shadow comes in many different colors and textures. It is
            usually made from a powder but can also be found in liquid, pencil, cream, or mousse form. Eye shadow can be
            applied in a wide variety of ways depending upon the desired look and the formulation. Typically application
            is done using fingers or brushes. The most important aspect of applying eye shadow, and makeup in general,
            is blending well. However, you must not forget to include a primer to limit the chances of creases in your
            eye shadow later. Price for eye shadows ranges from #3000 and above.</p>
